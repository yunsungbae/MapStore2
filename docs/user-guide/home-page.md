In order to get started, let us look at the portal interface and get an idea of how to navigate around it. Some functionalities are only restricted for 
*Administrators* and will be pointed out once encountered. However, you will learn more about *Administrators*, *Users* and *Groups* [here](). 

Once logged in as *Administrator*, the *Welcome Home Page* shows up as in the figure below and you will be able to view and make use of all the functionalities.

# Menu bar

On the top of the page, you can find the *Main Menubar* showing the following menus :
* Connections to [GeoSolutions](https://www.geo-solutions.it/), Featured and Contents sections <img src="img/connections.png" style="width:100px;height:20px;" /> (will be treated later). 
* Language Switcher 
<img src="img/language-switcher.png" style="width:px;height:px;" />
* Your own account manager

* Accounts manager 
<img src="img/manage-accounts.png" style="width:px;height:px;" />

**NOTE:**
The *Accounts manager* is reserved to the *Administrator* where he can manage *Users* and *Groups*.

# Search bar

Under the menu bar, you can use the *Search bar* to search stored maps and dashboards in [MapStore](https://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/).

# New Map and Dashboard

Under the search bar you can find two icon buttons to create a <span style="color:red">New Map</span> or a <span style="color:blue">New Dashboard</span>.

Depending on the permissions, the user can view and use the configuration icon buttons for each map or dashboard.
